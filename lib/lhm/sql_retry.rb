  # SqlRetry standardizes the interface for retry behavior in components like
  # Entangler, AtomicSwitcher, ChunkerInsert.
  #
  # By default if an error includes the message "Lock wait timeout exceeded", or
  # "Deadlock found when trying to get lock", SqlRetry will retry again
  # once the MySQL client returns control to the caller, plus one second.
  # It will retry a total of 10 times and output to the logger a description
  # of the retry with error information, retry count, and elapsed time.
  #
  # This behavior can be modified by passing `options` that are documented in
  # https://github.com/kamui/retriable. Additionally, a "log_prefix" option,
  # which is unique to SqlRetry can be used to prefix log output.
